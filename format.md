# Spec format

Each spec is a single Markdown file in this folder. The first line is always:

```
status: <value>
```

followed immediately by a second line giving the spec's creation date:

```
date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
```

`date` is set once, when the spec is created, and never edited afterward — it's used to sort specs within a status group, newest first. Specs written before this field existed have no `date` line; they sort as oldest within their group.

Optionally, a third frontmatter line gives a one-line, glanceable description of the spec:

```
tagline: <short one-line description>
```

`tagline` is shown by `spox list -t`. It's optional — specs without one still list normally under `-t`, just with no tagline text.

Valid statuses:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `draft` | Being written, not ready to implement |
| `ongoing` | Actively being built |
| `pending-verification` | Built, awaiting confirmation it works as intended |
| `completed` | Built and verified |
| `discarded` | Decided against — keep the file for context |

## File naming

Use short kebab-case names that describe the feature or system, not the task.
Good: `map-grid.md`, `pawn-needs.md`, `trust-system.md`
Avoid: `implement-map.md`, `fix-camera.md`

## Structure

After the status and date lines, each spec follows this shape:

```markdown
status: ongoing
date: 2026-03-14

# Title

## Intent
What this is for and why it exists. One paragraph max.

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Something verifiable — can be checked by running the game or a test
- [ ] Another criterion

## Non-goals
What's explicitly out of scope for this spec. Optional — omit if there's nothing worth excluding.

## Notes
Design decisions, open questions, or implementation detail worth preserving.
```

Acceptance criteria should be things you can actually check — visible in the running game,
covered by a test, or confirmed by reading the output. Vague criteria ("feels good", "works well")
belong in Notes, not criteria.

Non-goals are optional but useful whenever a feature request could plausibly be read as bigger
than intended — they record what was deliberately excluded, not just what wasn't mentioned.
